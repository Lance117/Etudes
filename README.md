## Description
- [bash_prank.sh](https://github.com/LanceSanity/awesome_bash/blob/master/bash_prank.sh) is a script that appends aliases to
your bashrc. This is a prank that aliases common commands to rick roll in your terminal. Source for rick roll in terminal: [rickrollrc](https://github.com/keroserene/rickrollrc)
- [setup.sh](https://github.com/LanceSanity/awesome_bash/blob/master/setup.sh) is something I used to install packages I may need for a fullstack app and create initial files.

## How to Use
`./<script name>`
